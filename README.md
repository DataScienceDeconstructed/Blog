# Data Science Deconstructed
## Where am I?
You've found a blog dedicated to aspiring and advancing Data Scientists
## What's a Data Scientist?
For the purposes of this blog, a Data Scientsit is anyone who leverages Mathematics and Computer Science together to identify nontrival insights from datasets.
## Why does this blog exist?
I've spent over 10 years doing Data Science and have been involved in mentoring aspiring Data Scentists for most of it. The question I get most is "What should I learn?". This blog acts as a repository for the tools and techniques that I've used to answer that question over the years and across several domains.
## How is this blog structured?
The "fundamentals" directory houses 2 other directories: Mathematics and Computer Science. Inside those directories are a series of tutorials along with code when appropriate.
